# Contributing to tg-react-sort

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **tg-react-sort**. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Include your environment details**: OS, Python version, Telethon version.
- **Provide specific examples** — include CLI commands you ran, error messages, or relevant log output from `sort.log`.
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and point out what exactly is the problem.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the use case.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most tg-react-sort users.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the quality of the codebase.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible tool.

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Ensure your code lints** — follow the Python Styleguide below.
3. **Test your changes** against at least one real Telegram channel.
4. **Make sure your commit message** is clear and descriptive.
5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request.

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
- Write clean, readable code with comments where necessary.
- Ensure async operations use `async/await` (the project is built on `asyncio` + `Telethon`).
- Do not hardcode API credentials — always read from `config.json` or `.env`.
- Sensitive files (`*.session`, `config.json`, `.env`) must never be committed — keep `.gitignore` up to date.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix FloodWait handling" not "Fixes FloodWait handling").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Additional Notes
