TG-REACT-SORT - CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS

1. WHAT THIS TOOL DOES
----------------------
tg-react-sort is a Python CLI tool that connects to any Telegram channel using
the official MTProto API (via Telethon) and fetches messages sorted by total
reaction count.

It authenticates as a real Telegram user (not a bot), so it can access any
public channel — and private channels you are a member of. It supports
incremental sync, reaction refreshing, date range filtering, batch processing
of multiple channels, and an automatic web viewer for analytics.

The web dashboard (web/view_results.html) displays the collected data with
charts, filters, emoji breakdowns, velocity metrics, and keyword analysis.

2. REQUIREMENTS & LIMITATIONS
------------------------------
A. REQUIRES A REAL TELEGRAM ACCOUNT
   - You must have a valid Telegram API ID and API Hash from https://my.telegram.org
   - On first run, Telegram will send you an OTP to your phone to authenticate.
   - This tool operates as a user account, NOT a bot — so standard user-level
     Telegram Terms of Service apply.

B. RATE LIMITS (FloodWait)
   - Telegram enforces rate limits. If you fetch too many messages too quickly,
     the API responds with a FloodWaitError and tells you how many seconds to wait.
   - tg-react-sort handles this automatically: it waits the required time
     and retries without crashing.
   - To avoid hitting limits, use --limit conservatively on first runs.

C. PRIVATE CHANNELS
   - The tool can only fetch data from private channels you are already a
     member of. It cannot access channels you have not joined.

D. REACTIONS vs. VIEWS
   - Reaction counts are fetched live from Telegram and may differ from
     what is visible in the app due to Telegram's internal caching.
   - Use --refresh to update reaction counts for existing messages without
     re-downloading all message content.

E. DATA STORAGE
   - All exported data is saved as CSV files in the data/ directory.
   - No data is sent to any external server. Everything runs locally.

3. FILE REFERENCE
-----------------
sort_reactions.py   : Main CLI script. Run this to fetch and export data.
config.json         : Saved API credentials (auto-created on first run).
                      NEVER share or commit this file.
session_name.session: Telegram session file (stores your auth token).
                      NEVER share or commit this file — treat like a password.
files.json          : Registry of imported CSVs used by the web viewer.
                      Auto-updated each time you save a new export.
data/               : Output directory for exported CSV files.
web/                : Browser-based analytics dashboard (no build step needed).

4. SECURITY SUMMARY
--------------------
- config.json and *.session files are gitignored by default.
- Your Telegram session gives full access to your account — keep it private.
- This tool only READS channel data; it does not send messages or modify
  anything in your Telegram account.
- If your session is ever compromised, revoke it at:
  Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security > Active Sessions.
